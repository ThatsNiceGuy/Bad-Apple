# Bad-Apple
Bad Apple in the menu bar

Original by neilsardesai

Forked by me, the only change will probably only be that imma put out a prebuilt binary or two.

## Building
This project will not build correctly with Xcode 12.2 without modifications, so use Xcode 12.4 instead.\
Of course macOS Big Sur is required. As for which version, I'm not exactly sure but I built it on macOS Big Sur 11.2.3 and it worked fine.

Just change the signing team to your own team, then hit run.


## Downloads
Prebuilt binaries are available. Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/ThatsNiceGuy/Bad-Apple/releases) to get them.
